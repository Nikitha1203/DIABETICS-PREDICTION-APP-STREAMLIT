# DIABETICS-PREDICTION-APP-STREAMLIT
Diabetes Prediction App using Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit[QSPYDER]
This repository contains code for a diabetes prediction application built using Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit. The Jupyter Notebook file diabetes_prediction.ipynb contains the analysis and prediction code, while the Streamlit file diabetes_prediction_webapp.py is used to create a web application for diabetes prediction.


Copy code
cd diabetes-prediction-app
Install the required dependencies:


Streamlit Web App
Start the Streamlit web application:


streamlit run diabetes_prediction_webapp.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

On the web interface, enter the required health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, etc.

Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted probability of having diabetes.

The application will display the prediction result along with visualizations of input parameters.

Development
If you want to modify or enhance the application, follow the steps below:

Make sure you have the project set up as described in the "Installation" section.

Use your preferred IDE or text editor to make changes to the code.

Modify the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook or diabetes_prediction_webapp.py file to add or modify the analysis and prediction logic.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or the Streamlit web application locally to test your changes.

Once you're satisfied with your modifications, commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
